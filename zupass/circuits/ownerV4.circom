/**
 * Module for establishing ownership of a POD object by the holder of
 * a Semaphore V4 identity.  The owner is identified by their EdDSA
 * public key, which should be externally constrained to an entry of
 * an object.  Ownership is proven by presenting the secret scalar
 * (derivable from the corresponding private key) as a private input.
 * 
 * Optionally calculates a nullifer tied to the owner's identity.  The
 * revealed nullifier will be set to -1 if unused.
 * 
 * This module can be disabled entirely using the `enabled` signal, in
 * which case all inputs are unconstrained.
 *
 * Boolean signals are assumed (but not constrained) to be 0 or 1.
 * They will usually be implicitly constrained when they are unpacked
 * using Num2Bits.
