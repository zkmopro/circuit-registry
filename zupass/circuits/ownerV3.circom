/**
 * Module for establishing ownership of a POD object by the holder of a
 * Semaphore V3 identity.  The owner is identified by identityCommitment, which
 * should externally constrained to an entry of an object.  Ownership is
 * proven by presenting the identity private secrets (trapdoor and nullifier)
 * as private inputs.
 * 
 * Optionally calculates a nullifer tied to the owner's identity.  The revealed
 * nullifier will be set to -1 if unused.
 * 
 * This module can be disabled entirely using the `enabled` signal, in which
 * case all inputs are unconstrained.
 *
 * Boolean signals are assumed (but not constrained) to be 0 or 1.
 * They will usually be implicitly constrained when they are unpacked using
 * Num2Bits.
